Automatically saves previous search and opens rofi with the same search text

Logs files opened and enables access to recent files via rofi-recent-files.sh

The log files are:

* FAQ
Q. Why is there a python script?

A. Because I couldn’t figure out how to parse Rofi’s output in Bash quickly, I got frustrated, and I used whatever worked. 

Q. Do you know your code sucks?

A. Yup.
